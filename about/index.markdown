Welcome
=======

I'm Jon Eisen. I'm a software engineer, mathematician, saberist, traveler, algorithmist, beer snob, system architect, etc. Currently, I work as a Software Engineer for [Norhtrop Grumman](http://northropgrumman.com), where I get to make large real-time embedded systems and impact enterprise initiatives.

Below you'll find some more information on me and things I've worked on.
