Kinect Robotic Control
======================
I used the Microsoft Kinect and [Kinect for Windows](http://www.kinectforwindows.org) to control a robotic arm and a robotic marionette. It was developed as part of an exploratory study for [Northrop Grumman](http://northropgrumman.com). I showed it off at [RobotFest 2012](http://robotfest.com) and the [USA Science and Engineering Festival](http://www.usasciencefestival.org). The code is located on [github.com](http://github.com/yanatan16/RoboNUI). A video of it in action is on [youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPZaGLFS9fA&feature=g-upl).
