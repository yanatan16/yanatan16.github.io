On Saturday April 16, 2022, the 8th running of Niwot's Challenge commenced. I ran it for the fourth time and finished for the third time.

_What is Niwot's Challenge?_ Niwot's Challenge (aka "Niwot's") is a footrace inspired by the [Barkley Marathons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barkley_Marathons). Competitors must navigate an off-trail, bushwhacking, difficult, vert-intense course using map and compass alone. See the [Official Course Website](https://humanpotentialrunning.com/niwots-challenge/).

### Race Preparedness:

- _Fitness_: I came into the race with some good fitness from a Dec-Feb training cycle, but I never got a chance to test that fitness. This being my fourth attempt, I was pretty confident with the navigation, even on sections I hadn't seen in a couple years.

- _Navigation_: During the leadup, I attended (and organized) booksettings to place the books and show the virgins the course. (This is a noticeable difference from other Barkley-style races, because training on-course is encouraged at Niwot's.) I didn't see every part of the course, but I definitely made sure I got out to difficult to navigate sections.

- _Gear_: The last 3 attempts all saw some sort of gear failure (losing map and pages, ripping pants wide open, injuring my foot due to plastic bags), so this year I started from scratch and found the right gear for everything I needed. I contacted others who do this stuff; I watched Barkley documentaries; I tried multiples of everything. In the end, I found a setup that worked for me.

- _Stress_: My stress levels were quite high in the week leading up to the race. I need to work on not letting race-day uncertainty interfere with my life.

- _Injuries_: Unfortunately, I injured myself (pulled quad) the weekend prior to the race. It seemed to be healing, and I hoped it wouldn't affect my race negatively. In addition, the nagging posterior tibialis injury was still causing discomfort, especially when hiking uphill hard.

- _Nutrition_: I did an alcohol and caffeine cleanse for the 3 weeks leading up to the race. 

### Race Day

_Race Intentions_: I wanted to go out relatively hard, hold the pace for as long as possible, and shoot for a sub-12 hour Burn loop (more than 2 hours faster than I did last year). Then, I would try to continue overnight at a good clip and and finish the 50-miler in under 24 hours. If both Brandt and I felt good enough to continue, I'd try to make the choice to attempt the deity.

As usual, I car-camped Friday night at the trailhead and enjoyed the company of other nitwits. I avoided drinking beers offered to me and went to bed around 9. I woke up, got dressed, and checked in; got number 6 (this is the page I must tear out of each book). I still had 5 minutes to spare after getting everything ready to go, so I zenned out in the car before heading to the bridge.

Sherpa lit the ceremonial pipe, and I started running. This surprised most of the others, but I wanted to set my intentions publicly. My buddy Nate ran faster to catch me, and we chugged along to the first turn. Unfortunately, I missed the new turn for the first book, but turned at the old location, and climbed to nab it. By then, two others who took the correct turn caught us.

This would set a precedent for my day: anytime I pushed hard, I would get careless and make a mistake. The next two books had new sections I had neglected to scout, so I relied on Brandt to guide us through. At the third book, people started sitting down, so I just left and took off down the hill. I looked up and realized I had forgotten which drainage to shoot for on the descent. By the time I had consulted my map, the others had caught me again.

Alex dropped back on the long climb to the fourth book, so it was just the three of us: Brandt, Nate, and I. They decided to take a scrambling "shortcut," which cost them 5 minutes. I decided to stick to the main route and made it to book 5 ahead of them. I took a moment to down a burrito and decided to continue on my own ahead of the others. 

I continued at a good clip until making another mistake climbing the wrong ridge to book 6. After I corrected, Brandt and Nate had caught me. At this point, I admitted that I wasn't in the right headspace to do this alone, so I accepted the group for the day.

Despite our strong pace, we saw Justin (a Niwot's virgin) before book 6, meaning he was on pace for 2 hours ahead of us! Incredible!

The next few hours weren't too eventful. We stuck together and kept a good, but not hard, pace. We chatted with nitwits going the other direction. We kept stopping to a minimum, ate a lot, and generally had a good time.

We got back to the trail above book 14 at 5:49, so I booked it down to the trailhead trying to beat 12 hours. I crossed the bridge at 6:01! Just missed the 12 hour mark!

Justin had indeed finished in under 10 hours and was already out on the Chief's loop. That put us in second and on good pace for 24-25 hours. I was happy with that. Obviously, Justin is in a different weight class. We refueled, took care of our feet, and packed our night gear. At 6:45, we headed out on the Chief's loop.
