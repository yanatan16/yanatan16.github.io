When I started running, I was pulled in by the community. Running was difficult and uncomfortable. I was out of shape and lazy. A local running group was friendly and fun. Soon, I was going every week to my local group, but not running otherwise. Then, a race. Then two. Then ultras. Then every race. Then... burnout.

I needed to find a balance of activities that allowed me to get what I love out of running without running myself into the ground.

Back in 2020, I was injured during the middle of the running season and looking for something to help me keep in touch with the running [Community](/running/2020/06/09/why-i-run.html) I love so dearly. I found volunteering and crewing at races and runs to be extremely rewarding.

#### Crewing

Crewing is the act of supporting a runner in their journey, usually an ultra-distance race or run. During a long ultra (think 24+ hours), runners will need hydration, food, rest, and company. This often involves a lot of logistics and planning. Sometimes, staying up all night is part of the job. Elite runners use crew like NASCAR pit stops, running through aid stations with the bare minimum of interactions. Most mid-pack and back-pack runners use crew like an airport layover, hanging out with their crew to refresh themselves before a laborious journey.

Crewing is a great way to support your friends and build your community. It also can be a ton of fun. I always have an adventure, seeing my runner through trials and tribulations. At races, you always see the runners around your runner and start to care for their race as well.

#### Volunteering at Aid Stations



#### Race organization and directing



#### Trail Building

There are many ways to give back to your running community, be it as an organizer, volunteer, or good friend. Nothing in the running world happens without our help. It's rewarding and enjoyable. Happy Trails!
