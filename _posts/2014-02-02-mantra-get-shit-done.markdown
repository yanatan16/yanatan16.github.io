Here’s what it means to me:

1.  Focus on building a product. If you find yourself doing things that do not contribute to the product, re-evaluate what your doing.
2.  Planning should be minimal but never disregarded. Use planning to gain buy-in from other stakeholders, but don’t lose yourself in planning.
3.  Embrace rework. It improves upon the original work by orders of magnitude.
