> All things end.

This is my mantra. I repeat it to myself nearly every day.

<!--break-->

When I'm on a hard climb, I say that all things end, including this climb.

When I was shivering and warding off hypothermia on the Tenmile traverse last weekend, I said to myself that all things end, including this run.

When I think about my life, I think that all things end, including my life, so I should live each day to the fullest, do what I love, and go on adventures.

When I think about my parents, I think that all things end, including their time with me, so I should call them more often and go visit them, even if they annoy me sometimes.

When I think about relationships, I know that all things end, including relationships, so I should soak up every moment.

When I'm sad and lonely, I know that all things end, so I should feel my sadness and loneliness thoroughly and let it pass.

When I have a migraine, I know that relief is just around the corner, because all things end.

My mantra isn't morbid, it's just life. It helps in ultras. It helps me deal with emotions. It helps me value my friends and my family.

All things end, including this blog post.
