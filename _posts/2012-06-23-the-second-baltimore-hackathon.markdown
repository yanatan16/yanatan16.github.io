A few weeks ago, a few friends and I hosted the [Second Baltimore Hackathon](http://baltimorehackathon.com) at the Ad.com (AOL) office in Tide Point. It went really well. We gave out over \$3000 in prizes to six deserving teams. Over 70 participants came in from as far as Bronx, NYC to compete.

Our prizes were organized into 6 categories:

-   Technical Complexity: This prize went to Radical Radar, a couple
    guys from Northrop Grumman who made a radar using coffee cans as the
    transmitters. They also had the analysis graphs live uploading to a
    web page.
-   Smart Design: My favorite project of the weekend,
    [Cartridge](http://crtrg.com/) is a HTML 5 gaming platform where you
    can write and play your games. Eventually, they plan to position
    themselves as a platform as a service, heroku-style system for game
    developers. My favorite feature was the github fork-like “remix” you
    could do to any other public game.
-   Aesthetics: This prize went to Color Palette. They created an iPad
    app that allowed easy creation of a color palette with simple
    gestures. Look for it soon on the app store.
-   Civic Service: To give tribute to the city we love, we created a
    Civic Service prize category. The winners were well deserving. Led
    by an employee of Ad.com, a team of high schools from nearby Digital
    Harbor High School developed a phone calling and meeting platform
    with advertisements, designed for the low-income customer.
-   Hacker/DIY: This was kind of a catch-all category that really found
    a gem of a recipient. Ahmed Abbas made 4 different Arduino shields
    for multiple uses in a single weekend, including one for WiFi and a
    digital camera complete with LCD screeen and camera.
-   Crowd Favorite: The winner here was deserving and expected. Most of
    the crowd hailed from the Baltimore Node. So seeing the winner was a
    group of members was not a surprise. They made a very nice door
    entry system complete with RFID’s, webcam, logging, and web
    interface, a great solution to the keyed entry system they have now.

This was my first hackathon, and I thought the projects were very well done. Congratulations to the winners and good luck converting those prototypes to businesses!
