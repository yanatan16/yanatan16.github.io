TLDR: I've become a freelancer. Check out my resume site at [joneisen.works](http://joneisen.works).

<!--break-->

I've recently ended my tenure with [Rafflecopter](http://rafflecopter.com). I had an amazing time there, expanding my horizons in many facets. I was able to work with smart people day-in and day-out. I also had the freedom to work with technologies I wanted to learn, and thus became familiar with more ways of solving familiar and unfamiliar problems.

A few of the technologies I was able to use and learn:

- Front End: Javascript, ClojureScript, React/Reagent, [dommit](https://github.com/notacatjs/dommit), Backbone, CoffeeScript
- Languages: node.js, Python, Go, Clojure, Haskell
- Databases: MongoDB, Redis, Neo4J, PostgreSQL, Cassandra, Kafka, ElasticSearch
- Infrastructure: Kubernetes, SaltStack, Vagrant, Docker, DotCloud, Linode, AWS

Some of the problems I was able to help solve:

- Scaling a websocket application to 10K simultaneous connections
- Migrating an entire microservice-based application across datacenters
- Managing a cluster of stateless and stateful services under failure conditions
- Helping scale development team practices from loosely coupled devs to a team

I've definitely grown a ton since I started there, and I'm ready for new challenges. If you or your organization would like to hire me to help you solve tough web challenges, or just to build your new distributed application, check me out at [joneisen.works](http://joneisen.works).
