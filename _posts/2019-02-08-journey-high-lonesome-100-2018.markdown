#### The Breaking Point

##### 8 AM Aug 3, 2018 - The Colorado Trail near Salida, CO

My body is spent. Every footstep squeezes the converging blisters on my feet. Every step shoots pain through the torn fibers of my quads. Every push with my trekking poles sears through my back. Every uphill tax my lungs until I wheeze. Every downhill feels like my quads are being burned in acid.

My mind is spent. It's been 26 hours of since I started moving; 26 hours since I last stopped. Deep thought has left me long ago. Simple math abandoned me as the first sun set. Determination got me here, but it too is fading now.

20 more miles to go. An impossible task. I simply cannot go one mile, much less twenty. The enormity of the task ahead overwhelms me. I break. I sit down on the trail and try to cry; my body fights me, rejecting the energy and hydration cost of tears. I yearn for sleep, for rest, for a respite from the pain.

I stare at the ground. I'm afraid to look at my pacer, my hero. I've failed her. I've failed my brother. I've failed myself.

#### Sam

Nearly eleven years ago, my brother died in a car accident driving back from an internship. His name is Samuel James Eisen. He lived for 18 years. He was friendly, passionate, and smart.

When it happened, I broke. I couldn't handle the loss. I couldn't reconcile what my life meant anymore. I buried my loss deep within me. I abandoned my family because they reminded me of him. I abandoned his memory because of the pain it caused. Any reminder of him would bring me to tears. I thought I was fine. I thought Sam would haunt me for the rest of my days.

Two years ago, I woke up from my slumber to realize that there was a way out. That was the beginning of my journey back to sanity.

#### CC

##### Mile 50 Aid Station of the 2016 Pine to Palm 100

I've been invited to crew my friend, CC, on her first attempt at a 100-mile ultra marathon. The race she chose is one of the toughest available, a point-to-point race through National Forest land culminating in a finish in Ashland, OR. With temperatures ranging from mid-30's to record-setting high 90's and an astounding 24,000 ft of vertical gain, this is a hard race for even the most talented of athletes.

I was unsure of how well CC would fare. I've never seen or done an ultramarathon. I knew her mostly from our weekly group trail runs and generally weekly drinking practice sessions. She's an experienced ultra runner, with a hard 100K finish under her belt from the year prior.

The early part of the race was going well. CC looked great, even when other runners were suffering from the heat. All that came apart at mile 46. I overhear a runner telling the aid station captain that there's a runner passed out, 4 miles up the trail. Reports keep coming in from runner after runner. Two fellow runners are helping CC regain consciousness, treating her immediate needs for water and salt. Our crew immediately decides to run backwards on the trail to her.

We make it a half mile out when CC comes jogging up with an older man flanking her. We escort them into the aid station. All eyes are on CC. So many people are helping her; I take a step back from the commotion to think about what's happening. She's going to drop from the race. We'll need to get a hotel room somewhere. She'll be incredibly disappointed. I'm not sure if she's ever quit on anything before in her life.

After what seems like an eternity, she finally speaks, "How far to the next aid station?"

My jaw drops. I can't conceive of the reality in which she lives in. Continuing this race now would be suicide. It's a safety issue. Surely her husband (also an ultrarunner) or the aid station captain will step in. Neither do.

CC stands up and jogs out of the aid station, with the cutoffs at mile 67 looming. She has a 3000+ foot climb in the darkness alone ahead of her. I'm in awe of this determination I can't comprehend.

##### Mile 67 Aid Station of the 2016 Pine to Palm 100

CC's husband and I stand atop windy peak in the middle of the night, anxiously waiting for CC's arrival. If she comes in after 2AM, she'll be dropped from the race by cutoff. Knowing the state she left in, I worry she won't have the energy to complete the climb in time. Each headlamp coming up the last switchback is a chance that CC will make it.

At 1:30 AM, CC comes running up to the peak of the mountain, hurried in her breath and clearly exhausted from running hard. It was incredible to see. Eventually she finishes the race in under 31 hours.

She has done what I thought would be impossible. From unconsciousness to pushing yourself up a mountain with no energy in your body. She immediately became my hero in my mind.

#### Journey

I'll never forget what I saw on that windy mountaintop in the middle of the night. CC's body and mind broke; she had a brush with death, only to get up and run. I saw pure determination.

Something clicked inside me. I needed to find that determination myself. Sam's death had broken me. On that night in Oregon, I saw a way to fix myself. If I can find that within myself, I can use it to help me find peace. I signed up for a 50 miler as soon as I got back.

Just like CC, I don't sign up for easy races. I ran the 2017 Quad Rock 50 as my first ultra marathon. I found determination in that race, but not the kind that CC showed. I needed a longer race. Later that year, I signed up for 2018 High Lonesome 100, easily more than twice as hard as Quad Rock.

I started training for the HL100 in January of 2018. With 7 months until the race, I had a lot of work ahead of me to get ready. Throughout this time, I worked hard with my therapist to process Sam's death, determined to come to terms with the loss at last. The efforts worked in tandem. Training runs helped me work through my feelings, and therapy helped me find motivation to run.

Through all this work, I finally found some measure of peace with Sam. I mended my relationship with my parents. Now, with my mind at peace, it was time to run the race.

#### Determination

##### 8 AM Aug 3, 2018 - The Colorado Trail near Salida, CO

Finally, I look up at CC. She coaxes me into standing up and walking. She is pushing me forward. I continue to try to cry. For the first time in 26 hours, I don't know if I will be able to finish this race.

I'm getting sleepy from the adrenaline crash of my episode. I'm drowsy as my eyes are slowly shutting. I need to find energy.

I close my eyes and try to remember why I'm here. I think of CC's determination. I think of Sam's loving eyes. I think of my goal of peace.

And in that moment, I found my determination, my will to continue. I have my friends around me, my brother in my mind, my parents waiting by the phone. They motivate me to keep going. A tear runs down my face. Not one of pain or suffering, but of happiness.

I can do this. I control my body. I control my mind. I don't need sleep. I can overcome pain. I will finish this race.

#### Finish

I hike the next 20 miles in 8 hours, finishing the race in 34:31.

I pushed through it all to accomplish my goal. And somewhere out on that course, I left my pain behind.
