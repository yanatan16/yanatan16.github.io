2021 has been a year of hardship, adventure, failure, and joy.

<!--break-->

I did this "Running Year In Review" last year on my facebook account. I copied it over to this website [here](/running/2020/12/30/2020-running-year-in-review.html).

Overall, I had a great year running. Over the past few years, I've been attempting to heal my trauma, which has in turn made ultras harder to finish, so thus I've been searching for "[why I run](/running/2020/06/09/why-i-run.html)". In 2021, I finally found some balance in that effort. 

The year started with a lot of change. I drastically reduced my drinking, completely abandoned my prior friend group (to get away from drinking and drama), and spent a lot of time alone. I moved into a new house in January and started falling in love with Miranda. Lots of good things were happening, but at the cost of feelings of isolation, abandonment, and loneliness. 

First there was the insurrection at the Capital. Then a man shot ten people at my local King Soopers, causing mass community trauma at the senseless gun violence. Our summer was marked by 100+ AQI days from fires in California and Oregon. And as I write this recap on New Year's Eve, thousands of people around Boulder are displaced and homeless after the Marshall fire ripped through Superior and Louisville. This is all without mentioning the global pandemic causing so much death across the globe.

Through all the hardship of this year, I found solace out on the trails. Since moving to my new house at the foot of Bear Peak, I have climbed it almost 30 times. I have raced 7 ultras, finishing 5. I failed at my two "A races." But, I had my best race performance to date at the Barkley Fall Classic "50K". And I entered the San Juan Solstice 50 Miler on a whim and had an amazing time down in Lake City, CO.

My adventures, both solo and with Miranda have made this year not just bearable, but enjoyable. Without it, I would have succumbed to the difficulties it presented.

In 2022, I'm looking forward to more Barkley-style adventure at Niwot's Challenge, Barkley Fall Classic, and possibly a couple other events. Miranda will be running her first 50 miler with me at San Juan Solstice (lottery-pending). It should be a fun year, and hopefully, a more pleasant one.   

Below, you'll find a year-end recap in photography form.

I was forced to quit after one loop, but what a loop it was! 14 hours 'out there.' I'm excited to see what I can do this year on a similar course!"

I spent a ton of time preparing for this race and the disappointment of not finishing was hard to deal with. The sun set the first night on clear skys and arose to a 150+ AQI day. It was tough conditions, and I don't regret the DNF, but I do mourn it."
