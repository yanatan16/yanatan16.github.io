Whereas [2021](/running/2021/12/31/running-year-in-review.html) was a year of overcoming hardship, 2022 was a year of working hard, focusing, and achieving goals.

<!--break-->

In addition to all the awesome stuff I did for myself in 2022, I also ran a ton with my partner, Miranda. We developed our relationship on the trails this year and it was amazing. Check out this [instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cm4DpEmLIQg/) celebrating our year together on the trails.

#### Goals

Coming into 2022, my goals were basically to run injury-free consistently, race fewer races but do better at them, and focus on building my relationship with Miranda through running together. Overall, it was a great year, and I achieved all my goals.

- Goal: 2,000 miles. Achieved **2617 miles**.
- Goal: 400,000 vertical feet. Achieved **540,515 feet** of vertical gain.
- Goal: Stay injury-free. Accomplished!
- Goal: Race more focused than in 2021. Accomplished by only racing hard on two ultras and two trail marathons in 2022.
- Goal: Do well on my "A races" (2021 saw failures on both A races). Accomplished with finishes at both Niwot's Challenge and Teanaway Country 100.
- Goal: Run Miranda's first 50 miler together with her the whole way at San Juan Solstice. Accomplished in style!

#### Racing

My year in racing was also excellent. I trained more and raced less and had a great experience.

- Niwot's Challenge (Barkley-style 50 miler) - Finished for the 3rd time, becoming the second-most finisher of the race (second to the legendary Brandt Ketterer, 5-time finisher). It was definitely the hardest course yet, as the new changes in the Chief's loop made the night loop more difficult than ever. [Read more in my race report](/running/2022/04/19/niwots-challenge-2022.html).
- Dash and Dine 5Ks - Enjoyed a change of pace from the slow hiking of Niwot's to race some quick 5Ks. I raced 3 of the 4 events and reset my 5K PR to 23:01!
- Hacienda Hills Trail Marathon - Early in our relationship, coach wanted me to hop onto a trail marathon race to get a sense of my abilities. So I ran this small race in the Bay Area. I didn't pace the race very well, but I ran hard and won (by default).
- BOLDERBoulder 10K - Put together my first running BB10K (I walked it with my mom one year). I ran well, enjoyed bacon and the slip'n'slide, and had a great time. Also set a 10K PR (barely) at 49:31.
- San Juan Solstice (50M) - This was an amazing experience, running the whole way with Miranda, guiding her through this amazing 50 Miler (perhaps the best in Colorado).
- Teanaway Country 100M - I finished my first 100 Mile race since 2018!! Finally, I put together a full 100M race, keeping my mental and physical control for longer than I had ever before. This high-vert race in Washington is awesome. [Read more in my race report](/running/2022/10/15/race-report-teanaway-country-100.html).
- Moab Trail Marathon - This was the race that got me into trail running, all the way back in 2016. It was awesome to experience it again, this time with Miranda. I beat my time from 2016 (not by as much as I'd have liked).
- Feaster Five (5M) - This turkey trot race rounded out my year on our trip to see family in Boston. I unexpectedly set a 5K estimated PR (22:05) and ran really well.

#### PRs

I reset PRs in 1mi (6:16), 5K (22:05), 10K (49:31) and trail marathon (4:55:00) distances.

#### Coaching

In April, I started working with Coach Nick at [Lightfoot Coaching](https://www.lightfootcoaching.org). It's been an awesome experience working with a coach. I've run faster, farther, and more structured. I'm so happy I made the choice to get a coach. I don't think it'll be a forever thing, but for this year of building fitness and strength, it's been invaluable.
