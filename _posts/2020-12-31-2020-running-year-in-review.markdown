2020 was hard on all of us. Like many, I found solace, frustration, joy, and injury in running. I ran more miles and more vertical gain than ever. I had to take more weeks off due to injury and had more burnt out time as well. It was up and down, but here are the highlights:

Primary goals set in Jan 2020:

- Run 5mi and 1000ft per day on average (Accomplished)
- Run another 100 miler (Accomplished)
- Run a self supported overnight (Did not accomplish)

Overall stats:

- Races signed up for: 8
- Races run: 3
- Total mileage: 1884mi
- Total time spent running: 514hr (12+ work-weeks)
- Total vertical gain: 392,000ft (13+ Everests)
- Marathon PR (Walt Disney World Marathon): 3:55
- Unofficial 50 Mile and 100K PRs (during Antelope Canyon 100)
- 3rd 100 Mile finish (Hallowed Hundred)
- 2nd Niwot’s Challenge Completion

Other:

- Captained my first aid station at the Silverheels 100
- Organized my first event, the Boulder Skyline Challenge
