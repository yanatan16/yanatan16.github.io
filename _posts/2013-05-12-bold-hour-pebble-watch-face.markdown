A while back, I got my hands on a [pebble](http://getpebble.com) watch. I made a n esoteric watchface which displayed time and date in binary. That was fun, but a bit uninteresting result.

I then took a look at the concept faces at [mypebblefaces.com](http://mypebblefaces.com). I picked one out that I could implement, and went forward with it. I created a watchface with a large image representing the hour and the minutes small inside. Its called [bold-hour](http://www.mypebblefaces.com/view?fID=700&aName=yanatan16&pageTitle=Bold+Hour+%28White%29&auID=598). ([Source Code](http://github.com/yanatan16/pebble-bold-hour))

It was quite fun creating it, and since then, it has become the 9th rated watchface on mypebblefaces, with over 5000 downloads. I very much enjoy the face’s clarity and beauty. Thanks goes to [dazto](http://www.mypebblefaces.com/concepts/?auID=146&aName=dazto) for the concept and to [pebble](http://getpebble.com) for the great ecosystem they are building.

I can’t wait to see the next evolution of pebble apps.
