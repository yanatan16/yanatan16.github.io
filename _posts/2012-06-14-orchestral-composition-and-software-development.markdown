I was at the symphony recently, the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. I saw
a new piece of music composed by recent Pullitzer prize winner Kevin
Puts. I was very impressed by the piece. I’m no music aficionado, that
title belongs to my wife; but I couldn’t help but be struck by the
intricate complexity of orchestral composition. Each instrument working
together in concert toward one sound, composed of parts that in turn are
composed of smaller parts. I was baffled by the complexity of it all.

I deal with large-system design all the time with the software projects
I work on. I found an odd similarity to the way system components and
abstraction layers work together and build off of each other to create a
larger system. It is of course composed of subsystems (that’s the only
way to understand it: abstraction), which are composed of smaller
subsystems.

It takes a system-level thinker to architect large software systems, and
it takes a special kind of artist to compose large orchestral works. By
thinking about composition as a kind of system design, I saw that the
mathematical intricacies of orchestral symphonies are similar to the
logical intricacies of software systems. Not all artists are composers,
in fact a strikingly small fraction of them are composers. This also
resonates as a fraction of software programmers have the system level
thinking skills to be architects. All in all, I think the skills
necessary to go from artist to composer are the same as going from
developer to architect.
