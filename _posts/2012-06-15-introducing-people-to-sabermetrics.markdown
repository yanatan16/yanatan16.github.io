I love baseball, and I enjoy the objective analysis of baseball,
otherwise known as Sabermetrics. I consider it a higher form of baseball
enjoyment. I can be in the game, yelling at the umps after a bang-bang
call at first base. But most of the time, I’m analyzing a player’s
mechanics, his advanced statistics, or considering front-office
decisions. Often, this has led me to step back from raw fandom and enjoy
the uniquities of the game, like just watching Chipper Jones effortless
swing, or focusing on the intensity that Craig Kimbrel pitches with, or
seeing Kris Medlen’s deceiving pickoff move. For the record, I’m a
Braves fan, born and raised in Atlanta.

When I meet people, I like to introduce them to this. I want them to
understand why I find that Baseball is the most interesting sport. This
is probably ironic to some people, who feel that Baseball is the least
interesting major sport. But there are so many intricacies and ways to
approach the game: fan, scout, front office, manager, pitcher, hitter,
saberist, etc. Each perspective has its own way of thinking about the
others and about the game itself.

When I start to indoctrinate a casual fan, the first thing I have to
dissuade them of is the notion of Batting Average is in any way
valuable. Most fans know it is flawed, but they still use it as a proxy
for “good”. This is a false assumption. Batting Average is the 2nd worst
conventional stat in current use (second only to Pitcher Wins). Why? The
first thing a new convert to sabermetrics has to understand is that hits
are heavily influenced by randomness. The difference between a liner and
a fly-ball is a matter of millimeters in bat or ball position,
milliseconds in timing. The human body is only capably of so much
precision (in fact, we are precise in very little in our daily lives:
its what makes engineers so unique, the ability to be precise when our
nature doesn’t conform). Certainly some batters hit more liners than
other, but once you consider the additional randomness of position
players fielding the ball, it is even more hairy.

Ok, so what does random influences in Batting Averages mean? Of course,
some players still have high batting averages every year. For instance,
Ichiro has always held one of the best Batting Averages each year for
the prime of his career. He is certainly not a random occurrence.
Randomness, instead, means that there are wild variations in
year-to-year BA (Ichiro over the years: .312, .372, .303, .310, .322,
.351). You can see that some years he is mortal and some he is
incredible. It is reasonable to assume he is not a very different hitter
in the .372 year versus the surrounding years. Thus, it would be wrong
of us to judge Ichiro on his .303 year, because he is clearly better
than that. The same goes for any time we use BA without a large sample
size (think at least 2 years).

The second big detractor of Batting Average is how its calculated. It
counts home runs and singles the same. For a player like Dan Uggla or
Jose Bautista, this is a travesty. Because it doesn’t weight each hit
appropriately (and completely ignores walks and subtracts for errors),
we can conclude it is not a good value metric (that is, it does not
accurately represent the value of players). What it does measure is how
much of the time a hit is made, which is good thing when in runners in
scoring position situations (because singles become more valuable than
walks in those situations).

Once someone understand what Batting Average is, and what it is not,
they can start to think about the game in a new light. Hopefully,
they’ll dig deeper, but maybe not. At least, they’ll know not to say
“He’s not even hitting .300” anymore.
