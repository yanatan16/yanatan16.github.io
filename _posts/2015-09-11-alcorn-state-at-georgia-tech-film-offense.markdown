I'm starting a little experiment this year where I as an amateur fan of college football watch my favorite team (Georgia Tech) and review its performance. I'll be trying to take a single play-by-play approach, combined a bit with some analytics, although a single game is a relatively small sample size.

<!--break-->

I won't go in depth about Georgia Tech and Paul Johnson's scheme, as there are many other resources out there for that.

The first game of the season was GT versus a high-powered FCS offense. Georgia Tech rolled 69-6, ending the first quarter up 34-0. At that point, most the the starters came out of the game. So I'll start with the Georgia Tech offense in the first quarter. It should be a good first taste of film study.

I'll have some quick notes below, and then three plays in depth.

## Notes

Here's some quick impressions from watching each offensive play from the first quarter. Remember this is against an inferior opponent in Alcorn State.

- Quarterback (Justin Thomas)
    - JT's option decision making was pretty good.
    - The 20 yard sack (see below) was a bad decision to extend the play after pocket collapsed
    - Passes were on target.
- Offensive Line
    - Run blocking was getting to the second level (linebackers) most of the time, which is really good. Even against 8 in the box, they got push, which allowed the good B-Back play.
    - The one goal line push was held in place as the line got no traction.
    - true freshman will bryan failed on the block that led to the sack
- Wide Receivers
  - Michael Summers blocks were not good overall on perimeter plays. The first play of the game went 9 yards instead of 30 yards because of a completely missed block. His TD catch later in the quarter showcased why he's on the field. His height allowed him to make a catch on a pass with the safety coming over.
  - I was really impressed by Ricky Jeune's blocking. He consistently pushed back his defender into the third level.
- B-Backs
  - Patrick Skov ran through defenders multiple times, bowling over linebackers left and right.
  - True Freshman Marcus Marshall has some breakaway speed, and showed it on a dive play where the blcoking was excellent.
- A-Backs
  - Blocking overall was pretty good, but not great.
  - Runs by A-backs were generally successful.
  - Broderick Snoddy made some great moves.
  - Qua Searcy really impressed with his shiftyness. Qua's catch was good too because he came back to the QB after he failed to get open on the wheel route.


## Plays

### Broderick Snoddy Run

1st and 10 from the Alcorn 21. Broderick Snoddy run for 20 yards.

![snoddy-start](/img/gt/alcorn-state-2015/snoddy-start.png)

Start: The classic triple option play develops.Thomas (QB #5) under center in balanced look. Stewart (WR #83) and Jeune (WR #2) out wide. Snoddy (AB #22) and Lynch (AB #49) at A-back. Skov (BB #7) at B-back.

![snoddy-dive](/img/gt/alcorn-state-2015/snoddy-dive.png)

Dive Decision: The classic triple option play develops. Thomas (QB #5) must decide to handoff to Skov (BB #7) or keep the ball. You can see DE #94 is inside of the RT #75, meaning he has crashed to tackle the B-Back. Thomas should keep the ball. Skov will get hit.

![snoddy-pitch](/img/gt/alcorn-state-2015/snoddy-pitch.png)

Thomas does keep, and Skov does get tackled.

Pitch Decision: Thomas only has one tackler in front of him and he's being stared down. He should pitch in this situation because Snoddy (AB #22) has no tacklers in sight. AB #49 and WR #2 are aiming to provide blocks.

![snoddy-run](/img/gt/alcorn-state-2015/snoddy-run.png)

Run: The ball is pitched to Snoddy (AB #22), who runs past the tacklers staring at Thomas. Lynch (AB #49) is cut-blocking the DB, and providing a nice hole for Snoddy. Notice how Trey Braun (RT #75) is 10 yards up the field harrassing LBs.

![snoddy-tackle](/img/gt/alcorn-state-2015/snoddy-tackle.png)

Tackle: Snoddy is being tackled at the 1 yard line. After being untouched for 15 yards, he slips the tackle by #27 and is downed by the other DB. I mainly include this picture because look at Ricky Jeune (WR #2) blocking 21 yards+ downfield. He has pushed his man at least 8 yards from engaging the block.

Outcome: An almost-touchdown.

Analysis: An excellent play all around by the team. Great blocking on the outside (Ricky Jeune!). Excellent decision making. Good running by Snoddy.

### Justin Thomas Sack

1st and 10 from the Alcorn 31. Justin Thomas sacked for a loss of 18 yards.

![sack-start](/img/gt/alcorn-state-2015/sack-start.png)

Start: Thomas (QB #5) under center in balanced look. Messick (WR #86) and Jeune (WR #2) out wide. Searcy (AB #1) and Lynch (AB #49) at A-back. Marshall (BB #34) at B-back.

![sack-dropback](/img/gt/alcorn-state-2015/sack-dropback.png)

Dropback: Thomas (QB #5) drops back without a fake. Messick (WR #86), Jeune (WR #2), and Searcy (AB #1) go out for routes. Marshall (BB #34) and Lynch (AB #49) block. 3 linemen and left LB rush. Will Bryan (LG #70) engages the DE #94. Marshall (BB #34) steps up to provide additional blocking on the left side.

![sack-pass-rush](/img/gt/alcorn-state-2015/sack-pass-rush.png)

Pressure: Less than a second later, the DE #94 has a clear line to the QB. DE #94 has shed the block by Will Bryan (LG #70), and is unnoticed by Marshall (BB #34).

Outcome: Thomas (QB #5) is harried less than two seconds into play. A pump fake slows DE #94's rush, but Thomas makes a bad decision to try and extend play and eventually gets sacked when cornered between two pass rushers.

Analysis: Thomas' decision was not well regarded by the coaching staff or by Thomas himself, but two true freshmen, Bryan and Marshall are to blame here. No pass rush of 4 players from an FCS school should get to the QB in 2 seconds.

Coach Johnson said in his postgame interview that the play was supposed to be a screen. This may be why Bryan's block was shed so fast. But there was no apparent screen setup by the time the line broke down. Thomas should have thrown it away.

### Marcus Marshall Touchdown Run

2nd and 28 from Alcorn 49. 49 yard touchdown run by Marcus Marshall.

![marshall-start](/img/gt/alcorn-state-2015/marshall-start.png)

Start: Thomas (QB #5) under center in balanced look. Messick (WR #86) and Jeune (WR #2) out wide. TaQuon Marshall (AB #16) and Lynch (AB #49) at A-back. Marcus Marshall (BB #34) at B-back.

![marshall-decision](/img/gt/alcorn-state-2015/marshall-decision.png)

Decision: The classic triple option play develops. Thomas (QB #5) must decide to handoff to Marshall (BB #34) for the dive play or not. He is staring at DE #94 to see if the DE crashes inside or stays outside. DE #94 is a good 4 yards away from the play and is staying home. Thomas makes the right decision and hands off to the B-Back.

Notice the up front blocking. The center (Freddie Burden #58) has engaged the nose tackle, and the right gaurd (Trey Klock #65) is gunning for the LB. The right tackle (Bryan Chamberlain #53) has sealed the DE #94. The right side of the line has opened a lane by splitting the two linemen and having a free blocker for the LB.

The safety #27 in the picture has already made a fatal error of charging in to an outside option play. This safety being out of position allows Marshall to take a 15 yard run to the house.

![marshall-dive](/img/gt/alcorn-state-2015/marshall-dive.png)

Dive play: The blocking just keeps going. Klock (RG #65) has completely taken the LB out of a play that ran right for his position. Chamberlain (RT #53) has even shed the block of DE #94 to get upfield to help the blocking. Burden (C #58) looks shaky on his block but holds it long enough for Marshall (BB #34) to slip by. Unseen in this picture (behind Burden's block) is Trey Braun (LG #78) keeping the other LB out of the play as well.

Outcome: Marshall ends up skirting Burden's block with enough momentum to outrun the safeties who played too much to the outside.

Analysis: While this is a 15 yard play if the safety doesn't charge in, this play is made in the trenches where the linemen got great push and were able to create a huge hole where Marshall should show off his speed.

## Future

This post took quite a while to put together, but I did enjoy it. I'll probably do something on defense and special teams as well as offense. for this week's game against Tulane.

**Go Jackets!**
