_Challenge yourself to run the Boulder Skyline!_

The Boulder Skyline is a classic of the Boulder area. It connects Boulder’s five highest summits connecting some of its most iconic trails. Whether you’ve never run the skyline or you’ve run it a hundred times, this challenge is for you. This challenge lasts from the Fall equinox (September 22, 2020) to the Winter solstice (December 21, 2020)

Entry is cheap and goes to a good cause. I'll validate all runs and keep a leaderboard on this website. I'll also setup a Facebook page so we can share pictures and experiences with each other.

I hope y'all will join me, your friends, and fellow Boulderites in pushing ourselves on one of the best local running routes.

## Entry

To enter, you must donate $10 (or more!) to the [Boulder Area Trails Coalition (BATCO)](http://www.bouldertrails.org) in support of the [Trail Around Boulder](http://www.bouldertrails.org/trail-around-boulder/).

Then forward me ([jon@joneisen.me](mailto:jon@joneisen.me)) your PayPal receipt to register. Please put "Skyline Challenge" in the subject line! Also make sure the email includes your name and preferred email (if different than the one you forward from).

## Leaderboard

_Leaderboard link will be available on September 22._

Results will be tracked for all competitors. We will have leaderboards for the most skylines completed and fastest runs (in both directions).

## Rules

- This challenge lasts all Fall 2020 from September 22 to December 21.
- How much does it cost? $10. See [Entry](#entry).
- What counts as a skyline traverse run? Any single run that summits South Boulder Peak, Bear Peak, Green Mountain, Flagstaff Mountain, and Mount Sanitas. It can be done in any direction: northbound, southbound, or in a random order! Double, triple, (quadruple!?) skylines are also allowed. Depending on your starting and ending points, its about 16-18 miles and 6000+ feet of vertical gain. See the route on [fastestknowntime.com](https://fastestknowntime.com/route/boulder-skyline-traverse-co)
    - You may complete the traverse from any trailhead and using any legal route you choose. But, in order to compete for the fastest leaderboard, your runs must follow the [FKT route](https://fastestknowntime.com/route/boulder-skyline-traverse-co) and start/end from the trailheads: South Mesa TH (South end) and Mount Sanitas TH (North end)
