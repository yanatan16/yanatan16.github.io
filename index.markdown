Welcome
=======

I'm Jon Eisen. I'm a software engineer, mathematician, saberist, traveler, algorithmist, beer snob, system architect, etc. Currently, I work as a Software Engineer for [Norhtrop Grumman](http://northropgrumman.com), where I get to make large real-time embedded systems. Check out [this page](/about) for more information on me.

Please excuse the mess while I construct the site. It is not fully functional yet.
