I like to build bikes. I've only built two single-speeds so far, but I have plans for a high-tech road bike, a lightweight cyclocross bike, a super-fast fixie with track wheels.

If you are in the Boulder/Denver area and would like a bike built for you, I'm always looking to improve my craft through practice. (See footer for contact info.)

Many thanks to [Sheldon Brown's](http://sheldonbrown.com/) amazing website. It's a huge resource to amateur and professional bike builders everywhere.

## Jon's Singlespeed / Fixie

This is my first bike build. I bought the old Allez Specialized frame for $50. It's 20+ years old and is definitely out of warrenty, but still rides nice! SRAM drive train and brakes. Wheels are by State Bicycle Co.
