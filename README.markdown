Jon Eisen Personal Site
==============

This repository contains the source for my personal site at <http://yanatan16.github.com>. It is based off of Mark Reid's site <http://mark.reid.name>.

IMPORTANT!
===========
I am very happy for others to use my design as a basis for their own site but PLEASE ensure you delete all my _content_ (i.e., pages, blog posts, etc) before uploading your version to the web.
