  Hi, I'm Jon. I'm an avid runner of mountains, trail, and ultra distances, and I work as an Analytics Engineer for Apple's AI/ML division. 
  This blog has been going off and on since 2012. 
  In its digital pages, you'll find writings about technology, programming, running, Georgia Tech football, bike building, homebrewing, and some personal philosophy. 
  These days, it's mostly running.
